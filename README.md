# python-glm-project

Introduction:

The purpose of this project is to develop a relatively simple way to access US Census Current Population Survey (CPS) data, with the aim of identifying drivers of wage levels in the US. This project will only focus on a small Generalized Linear Model (GLM); namely, the relationship between wage levels, the level of education and gender but the class below can also handle more complex models. Firstly, the methodology used to access and analyse the data will be outlined. The results of the analysis will then be discussed. Finally, a brief summary of the finding will be provided and ideas for future analysis discussed.

Class: 

The class 'CPSAnalysis'is designed to allow quick access and analysis of the Current Population Survey (CPS) data. The class includes (as a default) a number variables; however, the variables can be changed, if required. The class also includes multiple methods that allow the user to plot a histogram and boxplot, fit a model, analyse the residuals of the model and show predictions.
